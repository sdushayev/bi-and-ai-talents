    "# Handle scalar multiplication.\n",
    "# Compute the magnitude (length) of the vector.\n",
    "# Normalize the vector (return the unit vector).\n",

    "# name\n",
    "# position\n",

    "# Each operation (add, view, update, delete) should interact with the file to ensure data persistence.\n",

    "# Functional Requirements\n",
    "\n",
    "# Option 1: Add a new employee by creating an Employee object and appending it to \"employees.txt\".\n",
    "# Option 2: Read all records from \"employees.txt\" and display them.\n",
    "# Option 3: Search for an employee by Employee ID and display their details.\n",

    "# Option 5: Delete an employee's record from the file using the Employee ID.\n",

    "# Use the EmployeeManager class for managing operations such as file handling, record searching, and updates.\n",
    "# Ensure your code is modular, with methods for each operation (e.g., add_employee, view_all_employees).\n",
    "# Bonus Challenge\n",
    "# Add validation to ensure unique Employee IDs.\n",
    "# Implement error handling for invalid inputs and file operations.\n",
    "# Allow users to sort employee records (e.g., by salary or name) before displaying them."

    "# To-Do Application\n",
    "# Objective: Create a flexible To-Do application to manage tasks with support for different file storage formats (e.g., CSV, JSON). The application should be designed such that adding support for a new file format requires minimal changes to the code.\n",
    "\n",
    "# Task Description\n",
    "# 1. Functional Requirements:\n",
    "# Your To-Do application should provide the following features:\n",
    "\n",
    "# Add a task: Allow users to add tasks with the following details:\n",
    "# Task ID\n",
    "# Title\n",
    "# Description\n",
    "# Due Date (optional)\n",
    "# Status (e.g., Pending, In Progress, Completed)\n",
    "# View tasks: Display all tasks with their details.\n",
    "# Update a task: Allow users to modify a task's details using its Task ID.\n",
    "# Delete a task: Remove a task by its Task ID.\n",
    "# Filter tasks: Filter tasks by status (e.g., Pending or Completed).\n",
    "# Save and load tasks: Save tasks to a file and load them from the file on startup.\n",
    "# 2. Design Requirements:\n",
    "# Separation of Concerns:\n",
    "# Support for Multiple Formats:\n",
    "# Minimal Code Changes:\n",
    "# 3. Example Usage:\n",
    "# Welcome to the To-Do Application!\n",
    "# 1. Add a new task\n",
    "# 2. View all tasks\n",
    "# 3. Update a task\n",
    "# 4. Delete a task\n",
    "# 5. Filter tasks by status\n",
    "# 6. Save tasks\n",
    "# 7. Load tasks\n",
    "# 8. Exit\n",
    "\n",
    "# Enter your choice: 1\n",
    "# Enter Task ID: 101\n",
    "# Enter Title: Finish Homework\n",
    "# Enter Description: Complete math and science homework.\n",
    "# Enter Due Date (YYYY-MM-DD): 2024-12-31\n",
    "# Enter Status (Pending/In Progress/Completed): Pending\n",
    "# Task added successfully!\n",
    "\n",
    "# Enter your choice: 2\n",
    "# Tasks:\n",
    "# 101, Finish Homework, Complete math and science homework., 2024-12-31, Pending\n",
    "# Deliverables\n",
    "# Python scripts with classes and methods implemented as described.\n",
    "# Clear comments and documentation.\n",
    "# A brief explanation of how you ensured minimal code changes when adding support for new file formats."
