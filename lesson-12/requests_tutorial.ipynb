    "An **HTTP request** is a message sent by a client (usually a web browser or an HTTP client like Postman) to a server, asking it to perform an action, such as retrieving a web page, submitting data, or fetching resources.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Components of an HTTP Request**\n",
    "An HTTP request consists of several parts:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Request Line**  \n",
    "   - Specifies the HTTP method, the URL, and the HTTP version.\n",
    "     Example:  \n",
    "     ```\n",
    "     GET /index.html HTTP/1.1\n",
    "     ```\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Headers**  \n",
    "   - Key-value pairs providing additional information about the request.  \n",
    "     Example:  \n",
    "     ```\n",
    "     Host: www.example.com\n",
    "     User-Agent: Mozilla/5.0\n",
    "     Accept: text/html\n",
    "     ```\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Body**  \n",
    "   - Optional part that contains data sent to the server (e.g., form data or JSON payload). Used in methods like `POST` or `PUT`.  \n",
    "     Example:  \n",
    "     ```\n",
    "     {\n",
    "       \"username\": \"johndoe\",\n",
    "       \"password\": \"securepassword123\"\n",
    "     }\n",
    "     ```\n",
    "\n",
    "**HTTP Request Methods**\n",
    "HTTP defines several methods, each indicating the type of action the client wants the server to perform:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **GET**  \n",
    "   - Requests a resource (e.g., web page or data).  \n",
    "     Example:  \n",
    "     ```\n",
    "     GET /api/users HTTP/1.1\n",
    "     ```\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **POST**  \n",
    "   - Submits data to the server, often resulting in a new resource being created.  \n",
    "     Example:  \n",
    "     ```\n",
    "     POST /api/users HTTP/1.1\n",
    "     Content-Type: application/json\n",
    "\n",
    "     { \"name\": \"John\", \"age\": 30 }\n",
    "     ```\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **PUT**  \n",
    "   - Updates an existing resource or creates it if it doesn't exist.  \n",
    "     Example:  \n",
    "     ```\n",
    "     PUT /api/users/1 HTTP/1.1\n",
    "     Content-Type: application/json\n",
    "\n",
    "     { \"name\": \"John\", \"age\": 31 }\n",
    "     ```\n",
    "\n",
    "4. **DELETE**  \n",
    "   - Deletes a specified resource.  \n",
    "     Example:  \n",
    "     ```\n",
    "     DELETE /api/users/1 HTTP/1.1\n",
    "     ```\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "**How It Works**\n",
    "1. **Client Initiates the Request:**  \n",
    "   A web browser or an HTTP client sends the request to the server.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Server Processes the Request:**  \n",
    "   The server examines the request line, headers, and (if present) body, and takes the appropriate action.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Response:**  \n",
    "   The server sends back an **HTTP response** containing the requested resource, a status code, and possibly additional headers.\n",
